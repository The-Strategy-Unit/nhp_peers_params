# nhp_peers_params

## Purpose

Generate an automated report that presents visually each scheme's selected mitigator values for New Hospital Programme (NHP) modelling and compare them against their peers' selections and the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE). 

## Instructions

Put in the `data/` folder the following supporting files:

* `all_params.json`
* `mitigators.json`
* `nee_table.rds`
* `mitigator_name_lookup.csv`
* `mitigator groupings.xlsx`
* `NHP_trust_code_lookup.xlsx`

Then open and render `transposed_plots_reportstyle_010724.qmd` to produce the HTML report.
