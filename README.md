# nhp_peers_params

## Purpose

Generate an automated report that presents visually each scheme's selected mitigator values for New Hospital Programme (NHP) modelling and compare them against their peers' selections and the National Elicitation Exercise (NEE). 

## Instructions

The `data/` folder should also contain `all_params.json`, `mitigators.json` and `nee_table.rds`.

Then render `transposed_plots_reportstyle_010724.qmd` to produce the report.
